L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver
This dua l bidirectional motor driver, is based on the very popular L298 Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver
Integrated Circuit. The circuit will allow you to easily and independently control two motors of up to 2A
each in both directions.It is ideal for robotic applications and well suited for connection to a microcontroller
requiring just a couple of control lines per motor. It can also be interfaced with simple manual switches,
TTL logic gates, relays, etc. This board equipped with power LED indicators, on-board +5V regulator and
protection diodes.

Controlling Stepper Motor
In this example we have a typical NEMA-17 stepper motor with four wires:

The key to successful stepper motor control is identifying the wires - that is which one is which. You will need to
determine the A+, A-, B+ and B- wires. With our example motor these are red, green, yellow and blue. Now let's get
the wiring done.

Connect the A+, A-, B+ and B- wires from the stepper motor to the module connections 1, 2, 13 and 14
respectively. Place the jumpers included with the L298N module over the pairs at module points 7 and 12.
Then connect the power supply as required to points 4 (positive) and 5 (negative/GND).
Once again if your stepper motor's power supply is less than 12V, fit the jumper to the module at point 3
which gives you a neat 5V power supply for your Arduino.
Next, connect L298N module pins IN1, IN2, IN3 and IN4 to Arduino digital pins D8, D9, D10 and D11
respectively. Finally, connect Arduino GND to point 5 on the module, and Arduino 5V to point 6 if sourcing
5V from the module.
Controlling the stepper motor from your sketches is very simple, thanks to the Stepper Arduino library
included with the Arduino IDE as standard.

To demonstrate your motor, simply load the “stepper_oneRevolution” sketch that is included with the
Stepper library, for example:

Finally, check the value for
const int stepsPerRevolution = 200;

in the sketch and change the 200 to the number of steps per revolution for your stepper motor, and also the
speed which is preset to 60 RPM in the following line:
myStepper.setSpeed(60);

Now you can save and upload the sketch, which will send your stepper motor around one revolution, then
back again. This is achieved with the function
myStepper.step(stepsPerRevolution); // for clockwise
myStepper.step(-stepsPerRevolution); // for anti-clockwise

Connection for the sketch “stepper_oneRevolution”:
