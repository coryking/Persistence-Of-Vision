L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver
This dua l bidirectional motor driver, is based on the very popular L298 Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver
Integrated Circuit. The circuit will allow you to easily and independently control two motors of up to 2A
each in both directions.It is ideal for robotic applications and well suited for connection to a microcontroller
requiring just a couple of control lines per motor. It can also be interfaced with simple manual switches,
TTL logic gates, relays, etc. This board equipped with power LED indicators, on-board +5V regulator and
protection diodes.
