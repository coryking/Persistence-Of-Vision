SENSITIVE HALL-EFFECT SWITCHES
FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE OPERATION

X

These Hall-effect switches are monolithic integrated circuits with
tighter magnetic specifications, designed to operate continuously over
extended temperatures to +150°C, and are more stable with both
temperature and supply voltage changes. The unipolar switching
characteristic makes these devices ideal for use with a simple bar or rod
magnet. The four basic devices (3141, 3142, 3143, and 3144) are
identical except for magnetic switch points.

Each device includes a voltage regulator for operation with supply
voltages of 4.5 to 24 volts, reverse battery protection diode, quadratic
Hall-voltage generator, temperature compensation circuitry, smallsignal amplifier, Schmitt trigger, and an open-collector output to sink
up to 25 mA. With suitable output pull up, they can be used with
bipolar or CMOS logic circuits. The A3141– and A3142– are improved replacements for the UGN/UGS3140–; the A3144– is the
improved replacement for the UGN/UGS3120–.
The first character of the part number suffix determines the device
operating temperature range. Suffix ‘E–’ is for the automotive and
industrial temperature range of -40°C to +85°C. Suffix ‘L–’ is for the
automotive and military temperature range of -40°C to +150°C. Three
package styles provide a magnetically optimized package for most
applications. Suffix ‘–LT’ is a miniature SOT89/TO-243AA transistor
package for surface-mount applications; suffix ‘–UA’ is a three-lead
ultra-mini-SIP.

OPERATION
The output of these devices (pin 3) switches low when the magnetic field
at the Hall element exceeds the operate point threshold (BOP). At this point, the
output voltage is VOUT(SAT). When the magnetic field is reduced to below the
release point threshold (BRP), the device output goes high. The difference in
the magnetic operate and release points is called the hysteresis (B hys) of the
device. This built-in hysteresis allows clean switching of the output even in
the presence of external mechanical vibration and electrical noise.
