HD107S

Full Color Digital Control LED

HD107S

Fastest Digital Addressable RGB Pixel LED
Description

Features

HD107S is a digital control LED light
source which integrate control circuit and
RGB LED chip in one package, and it
provides the best full color lighting
performance for RGB digital dimming
control.
It featured a two-wire SPI interface instead
of the proprietary one-wire protocol like
WS2812, and many micro-controllers can
drive it with their hardware SPI functions
easily.
Also, HD107S is a more advanced version
of digital RGB LED of APA102, so it is fully
compatible with APA102.
It can operates at a oscillator frequency of
40MHz thus allowing a super fast data
transmission rate and fastest PWM refresh
rate over 26kHz, and it adjust the emitting
color with 256 (controlled by 8 bits) grades
of gray scale and 32 grades (controlled by
5 bits) of brightness adjustment.
Requiring a minimum number of external
components, HD107S is not needed a
decoupling cAPAcitors at it`s power input
pin. And it is available in a standard 6-lead
5050 package.
HD107S internally include intelligent digital
port data latch, signal reshaping
amplification drive circuit and a
programmable constant current driver for
RGB leds, effectively ensuring the pixel
point light color consistent.

HD107S

Full Color Digital Control LED

Operating Characteristic
HD107S is a full color digital control LED, and it uses a standard two wire SPI protocol, one
clock line and one data line. Each LED has two inputs and two outputs which can be daisy
chained, so it has a great advantage of being supported by standard micro-controller
periphery and it is insensitive to timing variations, and the data can be transferred reliably at
an arbitrary clock rate under 40MHz. HD107S uses PWM frequency of +26KHz to drive the
R/G/B LED inside with constant current.
NOTE: The maximum clock rate is mainly limited by the parasitics of the wiring, so take
care of the layout of components and wiring.
The data format is shown below.

Each update of data format consists of a start frame of 32 zeroes, 32 bits for every LED
frame and an end frame of 32 ones.A minimum of 32 zeroes are required for it to initiate a
new data update, and increasing the number of zeroes does not affect.
The LED frame consists of global bit and RGB bit, and it is identified by the first one bit
following the start frame.The LED output color is updated immediately after the first valid
LED frame, and the most significant bit of the LED frame has to be “1”, as it is used to
identify the start of the frame. And the next two bits serve no function but recommend to set
them to “1”.
Global bit: 5 bit (32 level) brightness setting, while controlling R,G,B three-color constant
current output value, if set the global bit for the 10000( 16/31 ) is the output current is half
again the original PWM settings. See diagram below:

RGB bit: 8 bit (256 level) gray scale setting, while controlling R,G,B color depth, and it
generates 16777216 colors, if set the RGB bit for the “00000000 00000000 11111111” is
the output of full RED. See diagram below:

The HD107S receives a valid SPI signal and outputs a valid SPI signal to the next devices.
Once a device detects a start frame (more than 31 zero bits), it will interpret the next “1”
bit as start of its LED frame. 32 bits are clocked into the shift registers, while zeroes are
pushed to the output. After the entire LED frame has been read, any subsequent data is
simply forwarded until another start frame is detected. The data line is valid only during the
rise edge of the clock signal.
The one-byte of data format is shown below:

Calculation of Refresh Rate & Number of LED points
Refresh Rate :
Frame rate = 1 / [ ( 64 + (32 x points) ) x T-CKI ] ;
unit: frames per second,
T-CKI: cycle of clock drive frequency;

Such as: 1024 points of LED, CKI frequency is 1MHz, T-CKI is 1/1MHz = 1us, so the frame
rate = 1/ [(64+ (32 x 1024)) x 0.000001s] = 30.458 fps. It means refreshing about 30 frames
in a second.
Number of LED points = (F-CKI / Frame rate - 64 ) / 32;
To increase the number of cascaded LEDs, needs to increase the CKI frequency or
decrease the frame rate.

The difference of all kinds of digital LED
HD107S RGB pixel led chip with PWM refresh Rate >26kHz and PWM frequency is 40MHZ.
APA107 RGB pixel led chip with PWM refresh rate 9kHz and PWM frequency is 30MHZ.
APA102 original RGB pixel led chip with PWM refresh rate 20kHz and PWM frequency is
20MHZ.
APA102C (packaged in china ) (fake APA102).
SK9822 RGB pixel led chip with PWM refresh rate 4.7kHz and PWM frequency 15MHZ.
