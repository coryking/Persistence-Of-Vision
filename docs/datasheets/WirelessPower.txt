Relation between receiving coil distance and output voltage and current
When the distance is 5mm, the receiving output is 12V2.5A

When the distance is 6mm, the receiving output is 12V2.3A

When the distance is 7mm, the receiving output is 12V2.2A

When the distance is 8mm, the receiving output is 12V2A; When the distance is 9mm, the receiving output is 12V2A

When the distance is 10mm, the receiving output is 12V1.9A

When the distance is 11mm, the receiving output is 12V1.5A

When the distance is 12mm, the receiving output is 12V1.2A

When the distance is 13mm, the receiving output is 12V1A; When the distance is 14mm, the receiving output is 12V1A

When the distance is 15mm, the receiving output is 12V900mA

When the distance is 16mm, the receiving output is 12V800mA

When the distance is 17mm, the receiving output is 12V700mA

When the distance is 18mm, the receiving output is 12V600mA

When the distance is 19mm, the receiving output is 12V500mA

When the distance is 20mm, the receiving output is 10V800mA

Note that the sensing distance must be greater than 5mm, it will be damaged by overvoltage if placed close! ! !
