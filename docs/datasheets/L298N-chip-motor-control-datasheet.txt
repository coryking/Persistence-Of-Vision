Description

Product summary
L298

Product label

The L298 is an integrated monolithic circuit in a 15-lead multiwatt and PowerSO-20
packages. It is a high-voltage, high-current dual full-bridge driver designed to accept
standard TTL logic levels and drive inductive loads such as relays, solenoids, DC
and stepping motors.
Two enable inputs are provided to enable or disable the device independently of the
input signals. The emitters of the lower transistors of each bridge are connected
together and the corresponding external terminal can be used for the connection of
an external sensing resistor. An additional supply input is provided so that the logic
works at a lower voltage.
